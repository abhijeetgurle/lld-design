# Low Level Design Interview Question

## Design a Notification Service

You need to design and implement a notification service for a messaging application. Users should be able to send notifications to other users through different channels (email, SMS, push notifications).

### Requirements

**Core Features:**
- Send notifications to users via email, SMS, and push notifications
- Support different notification types: MESSAGE, FRIEND_REQUEST, LIKE, COMMENT
- Users can configure notification preferences (enable/disable per type and channel)
- Track notification status: PENDING, SENT, DELIVERED, FAILED
- Implement rate limiting per user (max 10 notifications per minute)
- Support notification templates with placeholders

**Business Rules:**
- A user cannot send notifications to users who have blocked them
- Some notification types have priority (FRIEND_REQUEST > MESSAGE > LIKE)
- Failed notifications should be retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- Users should not receive duplicate notifications for the same event within 5 minutes

### Your Task

Design and implement the object-oriented solution including:

1. **Class Design**: Create classes/interfaces with proper relationships, inheritance, and design patterns
2. **Core APIs**: Implement methods for:
   - `sendNotification(userId, recipientId, type, content)`
   - `updateNotificationPreferences(userId, preferences)`
   - `getNotificationHistory(userId, limit)`
   - `markAsRead(userId, notificationId)`

3. **Data Models**: Define the structure for:
   - User, Notification, NotificationPreference
   - Enum types and constants

4. **Key Components**: Implement:
   - NotificationService (main service class)
   - NotificationSender interface with concrete implementations
   - RateLimiter component
   - NotificationTemplate system

**Constraints:**
- Use object-oriented programming principles
- Apply appropriate design patterns (Strategy, Factory, Observer, etc.)
- Handle edge cases and exceptions properly
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Consider thread safety if applicable

**Bonus Points:**
- Implement a notification queue system
- Add validation and error handling
- Design for extensibility (easy to add new notification channels)

# Evaluation 1

## **EVALUATION REPORT**

### **Rating: 6.5/10**
### **Hiring Decision: No Hire**

---

## **Detailed Analysis**

### **✅ Strengths**

1. **Good Project Structure**: Clean separation of concerns with entities, services, repositories, and interfaces
2. **Repository Pattern**: Proper implementation of repository pattern with abstract interfaces
3. **Dependency Injection**: Services properly depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
4. **Data Classes**: Good use of Python dataclasses for entities
5. **Enums**: Proper use of enums for type safety
6. **Working Solution**: The code runs and demonstrates basic functionality
7. **Template System**: Basic template system with placeholder support

### **❌ Critical Issues**

#### **1. Missing Core Requirements (Major)**
- **No Rate Limiting**: The requirement for "max 10 notifications per minute" is completely missing
- **No Retry Logic**: Failed notifications should retry 3 times with exponential backoff - not implemented
- **No Duplicate Prevention**: Missing the 5-minute duplicate notification prevention
- **No Blocking Logic**: Users should not receive notifications from blocked users - missing
- **No Priority Handling**: FRIEND_REQUEST > MESSAGE > LIKE priority system not implemented

#### **2. Design Pattern Issues (Major)**
- **No Strategy Pattern**: NotificationSenderService should use Strategy pattern for different channels (Email, SMS, Push)
- **No Factory Pattern**: No factory for creating different notification senders
- **Missing Observer Pattern**: Could be used for notification status updates

#### **3. API Design Problems (Major)**
- **Missing Required APIs**: 
  - `updateNotificationPreferences()` - not implemented
  - `getNotificationHistory()` - not implemented  
  - `markAsRead()` - not implemented
- **Incorrect Channel Handling**: Sending to all enabled channels instead of respecting user's channel preferences per notification type

#### **4. Data Model Issues (Medium)**
- **Type Confusion**: `channel` field in Notification stores `NotificationChannelPreference` instead of `NotificationChannelType`
- **Missing Fields**: No `read_status`, `retry_count`, `last_retry_at` fields
- **Poor Validation**: Minimal validation in entities

#### **5. Business Logic Flaws (Major)**
- **Wrong Preference Logic**: Code sends to all enabled channels regardless of notification type preferences
- **No Status Tracking**: Notifications marked as SENT immediately without actual delivery confirmation
- **Missing Error Handling**: No exception handling for failed sends

#### **6. Code Quality Issues (Medium)**
- **Inconsistent Naming**: `dest` instead of `destination`
- **Poor Error Messages**: Generic error messages
- **Missing Documentation**: No docstrings or comments
- **Thread Safety**: No consideration for concurrent access

### **❌ Missing Advanced Features**
- No notification queue system
- No proper logging/monitoring
- No configuration management
- No testing beyond basic flow test

## **What a Strong Hire Solution Would Include**

```python
# Example of missing Strategy pattern
class NotificationSender(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send(self, notification: Notification) -> bool:
        pass

class EmailSender(NotificationSender):
    def send(self, notification: Notification) -> bool:
        # Email-specific logic
        pass

class SMSSender(NotificationSender):
    def send(self, notification: Notification) -> bool:
        # SMS-specific logic
        pass

# Rate limiter implementation
class RateLimiter:
    def can_send(self, user_id: str) -> bool:
        # Check if user has exceeded 10 notifications/minute
        pass

# Proper retry mechanism
class NotificationProcessor:
    def process_with_retry(self, notification: Notification):
        max_retries = 3
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            if self.send_notification(notification):
                return
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

## **Interview Feedback**

**Positive:**
- Shows understanding of clean architecture principles
- Good separation of concerns
- Working implementation demonstrates basic competency

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Requirements Analysis**: Failed to implement 60% of the stated requirements
- **Design Patterns**: Missing key patterns that were explicitly mentioned
- **API Design**: Incomplete API implementation
- **Business Logic**: Fundamental flaws in notification delivery logic
- **Error Handling**: Insufficient consideration of failure scenarios

**Recommendation:** This solution demonstrates junior-to-mid level skills but lacks the depth and completeness expected for a FAANG-level position. The candidate would benefit from focusing on requirements analysis, design patterns, and robust error handling before attempting senior roles.

### **🔧 Minor Areas Still Needing Attention**

1. **Business Logic Gaps** (Medium Impact)
   - Missing duplicate prevention (5-minute window)
   - No blocking logic implementation
   - Priority handling not fully implemented
   - Preference logic uses sender's preferences instead of receiver's

2. **Repository Completeness** (Low Impact)

   - Could benefit from more query methods

3. **Advanced Features** (Enhancement)
   - No notification queue system (was bonus)
   - Could add more sophisticated monitoring
