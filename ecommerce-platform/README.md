## Interview Questions

### 1. High-Level Architecture Design (15-20 minutes)

**Question:** "Let's start with the overall architecture. How would you design the high-level components of this e-commerce platform? What services would you create and how would they interact?"

**Follow-up questions:**
- Which architectural pattern would you choose (Monolith vs Microservices) and why?
- How would you handle communication between services?
- What databases would you use for different components?
- How would you ensure data consistency across services?

### 2. Database Design (15-20 minutes)

**Question:** "Now let's dive into the database design. Design the database schema for the core entities: Users, Products, Orders, and Inventory. Show me the tables, relationships, and key constraints."

**Follow-up questions:**
- How would you handle product variants (different sizes, colors)?
- What indexes would you create and why?
- How would you partition large tables like Orders?
- How would you handle soft deletes vs hard deletes?
- Design the schema for handling multiple addresses per user
- How would you store and query product categories (hierarchical structure)?

### 3. Inventory Management Deep Dive (15-20 minutes)

**Question:** "One of the critical challenges in e-commerce is inventory management. How would you design a system that handles real-time inventory updates, especially when multiple users are trying to buy the same product simultaneously?"

**Follow-up questions:**
- How would you prevent overselling?
- What happens when inventory becomes negative due to concurrent orders?
- How would you handle inventory across multiple warehouses?
- Design the inventory reservation mechanism during checkout
- How would you handle cancelled orders and inventory rollback?
- What's your approach for handling flash sales with limited inventory?

### 4. Order Processing System (15-20 minutes)

**Question:** "Design the order processing workflow from cart checkout to order completion. Consider the various states an order goes through and how you'd handle failures at each step."

**Follow-up questions:**
- How would you ensure atomicity in order creation (inventory deduction, payment processing)?
- What happens if payment fails after inventory is reserved?
- How would you handle partial order fulfillment?
- Design the state machine for order status transitions
- How would you implement order modifications and cancellations?
- How would you handle returns and refunds?

### 5. Payment Processing (10-15 minutes)

**Question:** "Design the payment processing component. How would you integrate with multiple payment providers while ensuring security and reliability?"

**Follow-up questions:**
- How would you handle payment failures and retries?
- What's your approach for storing sensitive payment information?
- How would you implement payment provider fallback?
- Design the refund processing system
- How would you handle partial payments and split payments?

### 6. Search and Recommendation System (10-15 minutes)

**Question:** "How would you implement the product search functionality? Consider both text search and filtering by various attributes."

**Follow-up questions:**
- What search technology would you use (Elasticsearch, Solr, etc.)?
- How would you handle search relevance and ranking?
- How would you implement auto-complete and search suggestions?
- Design the system for handling faceted search (filter by price, brand, etc.)
- How would you keep search indexes in sync with the database?

### 7. Caching Strategy (10 minutes)

**Question:** "What would be your caching strategy for this e-commerce platform?"

**Follow-up questions:**
- What data would you cache and at what levels?
- How would you handle cache invalidation?
- What's your strategy for caching user-specific data like cart contents?
- How would you implement cache-aside vs write-through patterns?

### 8. API Design (10-15 minutes)

**Question:** "Design the key APIs for the order management system. Show me the request/response formats and discuss the API design principles you're following."

**Follow-up questions:**
- How would you version your APIs?
- What's your approach for API authentication and authorization?
- How would you handle API rate limiting?
- Design pagination for listing APIs
- How would you implement bulk operations?

### 9. Scalability and Performance (10-15 minutes)

**Follow-up questions:**
- What components would be your bottlenecks?
- How would you implement horizontal scaling?
- What's your database sharding strategy?
- How would you handle hot partitions?
- What metrics would you monitor?

### 10. Error Handling and Reliability (10 minutes)

**Question:** "How would you handle failures and ensure system reliability?"

**Follow-up questions:**

- How would you implement circuit breakers?
- What's your approach for data backup and disaster recovery?
- How would you handle data corruption scenarios?
- Design your logging and monitoring strategy

## Code Implementation Expectations

### What the interviewer might ask you to code:

1. **Inventory Service Methods**
   ```java
   // Implement these methods
   public boolean reserveInventory(String productId, int quantity, String orderId);
   public void releaseInventory(String productId, int quantity, String orderId);
   public int getAvailableInventory(String productId);
   ```

2. **Order State Machine**
   ```java
   // Design and implement order state transitions
   public class OrderStateMachine {
       public boolean transitionState(Order order, OrderStatus newStatus);
       public List<OrderStatus> getValidTransitions(OrderStatus currentStatus);
   }
   ```

3. **Shopping Cart Implementation**
   ```java
   // Thread-safe shopping cart operations
   public class ShoppingCart {
       public void addItem(String productId, int quantity);
       public void removeItem(String productId);
       public void updateQuantity(String productId, int newQuantity);
       public BigDecimal calculateTotal();
   }
   ```

4. **Payment Processing**
   ```java
   // Payment processing with multiple providers
   public class PaymentProcessor {
       public PaymentResult processPayment(PaymentRequest request);
       public PaymentResult processRefund(RefundRequest request);
   }
   ```
