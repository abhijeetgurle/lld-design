# Low Level Design Interview: Ride Matching System

## Problem Statement

Design a **Ride Matching System** for a ride-sharing platform like Uber. The system should efficiently match riders with drivers based on proximity, preferences, and availability.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Driver Management**
   - Drivers can register and update their profile
   - Drivers can go online/offline
   - Drivers can update their current location
   - Drivers can set their vehicle type and capacity

2. **Rider Management**
   - Riders can register and update their profile
   - Riders can request rides with pickup and destination locations
   - Riders can specify ride preferences (vehicle type, price range)
   - Riders can cancel ride requests

3. **Ride Matching**
   - Match riders with the most suitable available drivers
   - Consider proximity (distance between driver and pickup location)
   - Consider vehicle type compatibility
   - Support different ride types (UberX, UberXL, UberBlack, etc.)

4. **Trip Management**
   - Track trip status (requested, matched, in-progress, completed, cancelled)
   - Calculate estimated time of arrival (ETA)
   - Calculate fare based on distance, time, and surge pricing

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Low latency for ride matching (< 3 seconds)
   - Support for high concurrent requests (10,000+ simultaneous users)
   - Efficient location-based queries

2. **Scalability**
   - System should handle growth in users and geographic expansion
   - Horizontal scaling capability

3. **Availability**
   - 99.9% uptime
   - Graceful degradation during peak hours

4. **Consistency**
   - Prevent double booking of drivers
   - Ensure data consistency for financial transactions

## Design Expectations

### Core Components to Design

1. **Class Structure**
   - Define main entities (Driver, Rider, Trip, Vehicle, etc.)
   - Implement proper inheritance and composition
   - Use appropriate design patterns

2. **Matching Algorithm**
   - Implement an efficient driver-rider matching algorithm
   - Consider multiple factors: distance, rating, vehicle type, surge pricing

3. **Location Service**
   - Design location tracking and proximity search
   - Consider spatial data structures (QuadTree, Geohashing)

4. **State Management**
   - Handle state transitions for trips and driver availability
   - Implement proper concurrency control

5. **APIs**
   - Design RESTful APIs for core operations
   - Consider real-time updates (WebSocket/SSE)

### Bonus Points

- **Surge Pricing**: Implement dynamic pricing based on demand
- **Driver Pooling**: Support for shared rides (UberPool)
- **Route Optimization**: Suggest optimal routes for drivers
- **Rating System**: Implement driver and rider rating mechanism
- **Notification Service**: Real-time notifications for status updates

## Constraints and Assumptions

1. **Geographic Scope**: Initially focus on a single city
2. **Scale**: Support 100,000 active drivers and 500,000 active riders
3. **Location Updates**: Driver locations updated every 30 seconds
4. **Search Radius**: Maximum 10km radius for driver search
5. **Vehicle Types**: Support 4-5 different vehicle categories

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Proper use of OOP principles
- **Design Patterns**: Appropriate pattern selection and implementation
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and maintainable code
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and edge cases

### System Thinking (30%)
- **Scalability**: Design for growth and high load
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms and data structures

- **Trade-offs**: Understanding of CAP theorem and design trade-offs

### Problem Solving (20%)
- **Algorithm Choice**: Optimal matching algorithm selection
- **Data Structures**: Appropriate data structure usage
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity awareness
- **Edge Cases**: Handling of corner cases and failure scenarios

### Communication (10%)
- **Explanation**: Clear explanation of design decisions
- **Questioning**: Asking clarifying questions
- **Iteration**: Ability to refine design based on feedback

## Time Allocation (90 minutes total)

1. **Requirements Clarification** (10 minutes)
   - Ask questions about scope and constraints
   - Clarify functional and non-functional requirements

2. **High-Level Design** (15 minutes)
   - Draw system architecture diagram
   - Identify major components and their interactions

3. **Detailed Design** (45 minutes)
   - Design core classes and interfaces
   - Implement key algorithms (matching, location search)
   - Handle concurrency and state management

4. **Code Implementation** (15 minutes)
   - Write clean, production-ready code
   - Focus on core functionality

5. **Testing & Edge Cases** (5 minutes)
   - Discuss testing strategy
   - Address edge cases and failure scenarios

## Sample Questions for Discussion

1. How would you handle the case where a driver cancels after being matched?
2. How would you implement surge pricing during high demand periods?
3. How would you optimize the system for cities with millions of users?
4. How would you handle driver location updates in real-time?
5. How would you prevent a driver from being assigned multiple rides simultaneously?
6. How would you implement a fair matching algorithm that doesn't always favor the closest driver?

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use **Java**, **Python**, or **C++** for implementation
- Focus on **core functionality** rather than complete implementation
- Demonstrate **design patterns** where appropriate
- Consider **thread safety** and **concurrency**
- Write **clean, commented code**
- Be prepared to **iterate and refine** your design

## Success Criteria

A successful solution should demonstrate:
- Strong object-oriented design principles
- Efficient algorithms for location-based matching
- Proper handling of concurrent operations
- Scalable architecture considerations
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Good understanding of trade-offs and constraints
